Register now!
Give us four hours and your laptop, and we’ll send you into NICAR with a fully-functioning data-crunching machine and the knowledge to use it.
One of the biggest hurdles to learning programming is the often bewildering process of setting up your computer. Veteran data crunchers and programmers from Reveal/The Center for Investigative Reporting will give you a virtual playground on your personal laptop that will allow you to explore all the tools you'll gather throughout the conference. In this four-hour workshop, we’ll introduce crucial programming concepts and tools and -- most importantly -- why we use them.
You’ll walk into conference sessions with a laptop loaded with many of the tools presenters will be talking about, and a leg up as you continue developing your skills once you're back home.
Additional details including the schedule for the workshop can be found on the conference website.

We hear a lot of the following during discussions about creating mobile-friendly data-driven experiences: “It’s not possible to make good interactives on mobile.” “It’ll hurt our work on desktop.” “It’s not worth the effort.” “It’s too hard.” One thing is true: Making a news app work well on mobile requires different methodology than is commonly utilized today – but that doesn’t necessarily mean a worse process or an inferior product. In fact, mobile-friendly interactives better serve news audiences, and creating these experiences is possible (and practical!) to do.

Let’s face it, most of us work at media houses that are never going to have a full data team. But we have plenty of evidence from around the world that there is another way! Millions of dollars are being poured into the development of tech hubs, open data portals and data-driven think tanks, all of which are collecting fabulous data, building apps and finding amazing stories, none of which ever reach the public. In this session, the people who have created new models for bringing together civic hackers and under-resourced newsrooms to collaborate on data-driven projects will share what it takes to make these partnerships work and evaluate their impact on the public and the media."

What if you could turn your laptop into a virtual drone -- obtaining immediate “eyes in the sky” capabilities for precise areas of interest. A capacity achieved within seconds and through a few keystrokes and clicks.
As smartphones become ubiquitous, the ability for communities to report on the world around them grows. By effectively capturing and organizing this data, we can accurately determine what’s happening through the eyes/screens of the people experiencing it firsthand.

It’s the great newsroom double bind: keep up with new technologies or risk becoming obsolete,. but do it while keeping up your day job (which takes all your time). If everyone in the newsroom feels this pressure, the news apps developers and CAR reporters who thrive on being the cool kids on the bleeding edge can feel it even more keenly. In this session, we'll consider some of the methods we use as individuals and as teams to overcome this challenge and build an environment that fosters continuous learning. A few questions we'll consider: How do I continuously hone my chops and keep current with changing technology if that’s not the only thing I do with my time? What strategies have individuals and teams developed that build learning into their workflows and routines? How can editors help create a team culture that supports learning and experimentation without sacrificing productivity? And how can these lessons be applied more broadly to help less technically minded reporters catch up and keep up?"

Usually the first step is using a relational (or SQL) database. While a relational database can be a good choice for some datasets, data analysts today turn to new tools to gain deeper insight. This talk will show how we can use a graph database to analyze highly connected data using examples from U.S. Congressional data and political email archives. Using the U.S. Congress data, we’ll show you how to explore the dataset using Cypher, the Neo4j query language, to discover legislator activity including bill sponsorship and voting activity. Building up our knowledge of Cypher as we progress, we’ll show how you can use principles from social network analysis to find influential legislators and discover what topics legislators have influence over. Finally, we will examine how to draw insights from the Hillary Clinton email dataset, released as part of a FOIA request earlier this year. We will explore this dataset as a graph of interactions among users, answering questions like: Who is communicating with Hillary the most? What are the topics of these emails? You’ll learn how to visualize these using the Neo4j browser to quickly make sense of the data as we are exploring.
The goal of this talk is to provide a demonstration of database tools that any journalist can use to explore datasets and draw insights from connected datasets."

Sometimes it's important to know whether a pattern could be a fluke. Is a stockbroker lucky or trading on insider knowledge? Did a player throw a game or have a bad streak? Is the lottery rigged or could the same person win twice?
Reporters often turn to traditional methods like a chi-square test to determine statistical significance, but other techniques, from poisson distributions to monte carlo simulations, might be a better fit. This panel will walk you through some of the methods you can use to answer the question: is it a fluke?"

Try to find as much information that can help you move the story forward with a watchdog eye. Set the clock as a timer for 5- to 10-minute intervals to see how quickly you can find information. Once you’re done, compare yourself to others in the room. This is a real life scenario where you can learn to break news by never leaving your computer.
